# Image-Processing-Swing-App

  The System study deals with the initial stage of the software development during the primary investigation. The System study is done for the purpose to stabilize the needs of the attaining, developing and the installing of the system. The primary investigation concludes with the results of the study phase. The development of the system life cycle involves the study phase which includes the study of process of an image. There are many image editors available which are too expensive. We need to develop our own system to process and edit an image.


# About Swing:
  Swing is a set of program component s for Java programmers that provide the ability to create graphical user interface ( GUI ) components, such as buttons and scroll bars, that are independent of the windowing system for specific operating system . Swing components are used with the Java Foundation Classes ( JFC ).

# STEP 1 IN GUI FORM:
  For this we need to add the image to a GUI form thus it helps us to make the image to edit whatever we want in the further process. To add the image we need some help of packages like awt (Abstract window toolkit) and also the swing. And to add the image in the we used some of the swing classes like Jbutton, JLabel and some other awt components for the graphics image part.

# STEP 2: HOW TO GET VARIOUS IMAGES

  Here in this we need to get various images to the GUI form. But to get the images collectively we need an option to get the image in ordered form. So we are using the JButton named Open Images to get images. Thus to go through all the drives for the images, we need to implement this action to the button. For this we are including the Actionlistener to the JButton. Thus it will give us the image in the required GUI form.

# STEP 3: PROCESSING THE IMAGES

  For each functionality like ZOOM IN , ZOOM OUT, BRIGHTNESS, SHARPNESS AND GRAY-SCALE create new methods and link the methods with respective buttons with OnClickListener.
